# IMDB_Project

This is a project that scrapes various IMDB api's and allows you a different way of searching for movies. If you search for an actor/actress, you can see all of the movies for the different filmography roles (ie Actor, Producer, Writer, etc) he/she has done. Further, you can sort the search results by IMDB rating or gross box office amount, and if you click on a movie, its information, poster, and trailer link will be posted to the right of the last search results. Currently the movie titles are translated into your country's language.

This project can be run on a Mac using MAMP and on Windows using WAMP

Steps:
Download MAMP or WAMP
Navigate to directory where you wish to store this project in Mac terminal or Windows equivalent
Git clone project_url
